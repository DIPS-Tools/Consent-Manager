# Consent Manager setup and run instructions

## Prerequisites

- Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Follow the instructions to setup the [DIPS Local Development](https://github.com/DIPS-Tools/dips-local-dev)

## Setup and run

1. **Clone the project:**

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/EU-UPCAST/upconsent.git
```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

```bash
  cd upconsent
```

3. **Install the required libraries**

```bash
  npm install
```

> **Note:** Mac users: If you face permission errors, you might need **sudo npm install**.

4. **Start the development server:**

```bash
  npm run dev
```

> **Note:** Mac users: If you face permission errors, you might need **sudo npm run dev**.

5. **Open the project in your browser:**

- Once the server starts, a localhost URL (usually http://localhost:5173) will be shown in the terminal.
- Press Ctrl + Click on the URL or copy and paste it into your browser.

The project should now be running locally.

## Using the Consent Manager API

The default base URL for the Consent Manager endpoint is [http://localhost:8019/consent-manager-api/api](http://localhost:8019/consent-manager-api/api). Documentation is available at /docs.

### Creating an account

Make a POST request to {API_BASE_URL}/auth/register with the following minimum requirements shown in this example:

```
{
  "email": "new_user@example.com",
  "password": "password123#",
  "name": "Hugh Mann",
  "role": "requester",
  "type": "consumer",
}
```

For a data owner, replace "requester" with "owner" and "consumer" with "provider".

### As a Data Requester

0. Register as a data requester.
1. Sign in by making a POST request to {API_BASE_URL}/auth/login following the example:

```
const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/auth/login`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "x-login-source": "ui",
      },
      credentials: "include",
      body: JSON.stringify({ email, password }),
    });
```
2. Create a request by making a POST request to {API_BASE_URL}/requests following the example:
```
const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/requests`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem("token")}`
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    });
```

Where data must contain the attributes:
- policy: a JSON-LD ODRL Policy as per samplePolicy.json.
- requester:
```
{
  "requesterId": the MongoDB Object ID of the requester.
  "requesterName": the requester's name.
  "requesterEmail": the requester's email address.
}
```

These values can be retrieved from the response to the login API call in step 1.

3. Send the request by making a POST request to {API_BASE_URL}/requests/{id}, where id is the MongoDB Object ID of the request, as per the example:
```
const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/requests/{id}`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem("token")}`
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(
        { "user_details": user_details }
      ),
    });
```

You can check the status of the request by making a GET request to {API_BASE_URL}/requests/{id}.

```
{
  "id":"123456789",
  "data":{
    "_id":"123456789",
    "requestName":"samplePolicy",
    "requester":{
      "requesterId":"987654321",
      "requesterName":"data consumer",
      "requesterEmail":"requester1@example.com"},
    "policy":{...},
    "selectedOntologies":[...],
    "createdAt":"Wednesday 15 July 2026 09:18",
    "sentAt":"",
    "status":"rejected",
    "owners":[...],
    "ownersAccepted":[...],
    "ownersRejected":[...],
    "ownersPending":[...],
    "contractId":"135792468"
  },
  "success":true
}
```

### Demo

src/test.py is a Python script that provides a CLI that encapsulates steps 1-3 for a data requester. 

#### Usage
```
python test.py --email email --password password --odrl samplePolicy.json --user-email user_email1 --user-email user_email2 ...
```
Or if you know the ID for the request you want to send:
```
python test.py --email email --password password --requestId request_id --user-email user_email1 --user_email2 ...
```

- email: The email address of the requester.
- password: The requester's password.
- odrl: The path to a JSON file for an ODRL policy.
- requestId: The MongoDB Object ID of a request object. 
- user_email: The email address of a data owner. Allows multiple instances.
